# TODO

## Bugs

* Investigate why docker doesn't update files
* Clean up docker scripts because I made a mess of them

## The Things To Do

* Make sure eslint + prettier work on save
* Husky + lint-staged
* Migrate what's possible for backend-old
* Add tests
* Add e2e tests that work with containerized postgres and redis
* Fastify plugins

## Notes

* If you want to debug the server container, you can run this: `docker compose run --rm server sh`
